# Game of Life
This code is a multi-threaded implementation of a game called the "Game of Life". The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. The code appears to be written in C++ and uses the pthread library to create and manage multiple threads. The supervisor thread monitors the state of the game and determines when it has reached a stable state or a "complete" state. The checkSpot thread selects a random location on the game board and evaluates its neighbors to determine how the state of the game should evolve.
